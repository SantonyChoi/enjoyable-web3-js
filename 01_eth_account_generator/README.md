# Ethereum Account Generator
This simple app generates a private key and shows corresponding address with its balance. You might find an account which is owned by some rich guy. Unfortunately, [it is a bit difficult][how-difficult], though.

## Prerequisite
<!-- - One of the two followings
  - [Metamask][metamask] (It's easier)
  - Local Ethereum node on port 8545, which is attached to Ehtereum Mainnet
    - [Geth][geth]
    - [Parity][parity]
    - or whatever -->
- Node.js
  - I used `lite-server` for running it

## How to run
```
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```
